** CAPI3REF: SQLite3 Transaction Timestamp Extension
** METHOD: sqlite3
**

** to determine the order of transactions and resolve conflicts in a multi-user
** environment where data consistency and integrity are critical.

** CAPI3REF: Get Current System Timestamp
** METHOD: get_current_timestamp
**
** This function fetches the current system time and returns it as a simple
** integer timestamp. This timestamp is crucial for transaction management
** and concurrency control, ensuring that each transaction is tagged with
** a unique time identifier.

** modification to the database, providing a basic concurrency control mechanism
** to avoid data conflicts.

** METHOD: modify_data
**
** Modifies data within a transaction scope, with checks for timestamp conflicts.
** This function attempts to modify data only if the transaction's timestamp
** is newer than the last modification timestamp, thereby enforcing concurrency
** control. If the check fails, the transaction is aborted.
